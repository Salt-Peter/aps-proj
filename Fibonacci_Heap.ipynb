    "Although Fibonacci Heap looks promising time complexity wise, it has been found slow in practice as hidden constants are high (Source Wiki).\n",
    "Fibonacci heap are mainly called so because Fibonacci numbers are used in the running time analysis. Also, every node in Fibonacci Heap has degree at most O(log n) and the size of a subtree rooted in a node of degree k is at least Fk+2, where Fk is the kth Fibonacci number.\n"
