    "\n",
    "We know about many datastructures that support priority queue operations\n",
    "eg binary heaps, RBT, fibonacci heaps TODO: add more.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in each of these atleast one among INSERT and EXTRACT-MIN takes $\\Omega(logn)$ time.\n",
    "A verification of the above conclusion is, because all of the above data structures are based on \n",
    "comparison between the keys and the lower bound found comparison based sorting is $\\Omega(nlogn)$ \n",
    "if we would have been able to perform INSERT and EXTRACT-MIN in $o(logn)$ then we could \n",
    "sort n keys in o(nlogn) using heap sort (n INSERTions followed by n EXTRACT-MIN operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also know that non-comparison based sorting techniques break this lower bound for sorting \n",
    "for eg: Counting Sort takes $O(n+k)$ time to sort n elements in the range 0 to k.\n",
    "Of course it is only true when integers(keys) are in a bounded range."
