    "\n",
    "We know about many datastructures that support priority queue operations\n",
    "eg binary heaps, Red Black Trees, fibonacci heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in each of these atleast one among INSERT and EXTRACT-MIN takes $\\Omega(logn)$ time.\n",
    "A verification of the above conclusion is, because all of the above data structures are based on comparison between the keys and the lower bound for comparison based sorting is $\\Omega(nlogn)$  \n",
    "if we would have been able to perform INSERT and EXTRACT-MIN in $o(logn)$ then we could \n",
    "sort n keys in o(nlogn) using heap sort (n INSERTions followed by n EXTRACT-MIN operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also know that non-comparison based sorting techniques break this lower bound for sorting eg: Counting Sort takes $O(n+k)$ time to sort n elements in the range 0 to k.\n",

    "Problem in routing packets :-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the IP adresses are distributed in blocks where each block is a subnet. Each subnet has some range, for example assume Router C shown above has one of its ports corresponding to subnet A which has IP addresses in the range $[ 128.23.45.0 - 128.255.255.255 ]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a packet arriving at the router has a destination address falling in above range, this packet has to be forwarded to the port corresponding to subnet A.Eg a packet with destination IP address 128.28.67.90 arrives at Router C ,since it falls in the range of subnet A, so it will be forwarded to port corresponding to the subnet A.  \n",
    "Each router in the network may have multiple ports , and each port is used to forward the packet to a particular subnet.  \n",
    "Every time a packet arrives at the router,using subnet mask its outgoing port number is calculated ,routing table dictates the port to which the packet has to be forwarded, this takes lot of time as millions of packets are processed in the network and the processing delay includes, using masking tool to get the network id and then looking up into the routing table ,although binary search trees come to rescue but still we can get rid of $Olog(n)$ by using van Emde Boas trees in $O(log log u)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remedy :-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now starting IP address of each range(subnet) is a node and we are required to find the predecessor of the IP address of the arriving packet to forward the packet to a port efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg. a packet with destination IP address 128.28.67.90 arrives at Router C ,prdecessor of this address is 128.23.45.0 which is the starting address of the subnet A, so it will be forwarded to port corresponding to the subnet A.vEB-tree makes the search exponentially faster than the BST.Successor and predecessor operations will take $O(loglogu)$ time where as balanced binary search tree takes $O(logn)$ time.  \n",
    " \n",
    "In general van Emde Boas trees can be used anywhere in place of a normal binary search tree as long as the keys in the search tree are integers in some fixed range. Thus for applications where we are required to find the integer in a set that is closest to some other integer(predecessor or successor), using a vEB-tree can potentially be faster than using a simple balanced binary search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, of you have a linear layout of stores on some line and want to find the closest store to some particular customer, using a vEB-tree could make the search exponentially faster than the BST."
